# puppeteer-rpa
Simple orchestrator to execute and log puppeteer recordings for robotic process automation (RPA) purposes. Designed to execute scripts generated by Chrome DevTools' [Recording feature](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2021/01/devtools#record) (available in Chrome 89+ only).

## Install
1. Install `Node.js` and `git`
2. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ardislu/puppeteer-rpa.git
```
3. `cd puppeteer-rpa`
4. Install dependencies
```
npm i
```
5. (Optional) Create a symlink to `./bin/cli.js` (to make `puppeteer-rpa` directly accessible on the command line)
```
npm link
```

## Use
1. Make a puppeteer recording by using Chrome DevTools' [Recording feature](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2021/01/devtools#record) (available in Chrome 89+ only)
2. Copy the recording into a standalone file in the `recordings` folder
3. `npm start` (runs `ts-node` on `./src/index.ts`) or `puppeteer-rpa` (runs `node` on `./dist/index.js`)

## config.ts
Modify the `config` object in `config.ts` to change default settings for the orchestrator.

## Notes
- The orchestrator will run all recordings in parallel.
- Example recordings are included for completing the forms on [jec.fyi](https://jec.fyi/demo/recorder) and [rpachallenge](http://www.rpachallenge.com/).
- For simplicity, the orchestrator does not allow you to configure the puppeteer settings of individual scripts. If you need to set puppeteer launch settings (examples: `headless: false` or `slowMo: 10`), customize the individual recording scripts.
